		How To Play:
		------------

	In MineSweeper, your goal is to clear all the tiles that are NOT mines.

	When you click on a tile, if it is not a bomb it will show the number of bombs in the surrounding 8 tiles.
	If you click on a bomb, the game is over and you lose.

	You can also "flag" tiles that you believe are bombs. This prevents you from clicking on them, and
	helps keep track of how many bombs you have already found. Flags can be toggled - to remove a flag,
	simply select the same tile again while using the flagging tool. The number of flags that you have placed
	is tracked above the board - starting with a number of flags equal to the number of bombs on the board.
	If that number goes negative, that indicates that you have a flag somewhere that is not actually a bomb.

	The timer above the board indicates how long you have been playing the current board in seconds.
	Try to beat your best time for each level!
