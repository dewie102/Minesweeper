		How To Play:
		------------

	In MineSweeper, your goal is to clear all the tiles that are NOT mines.

	When you click on a tile, if it is a bomb it will show the number of bombs in the surrounding 8 tiles.
	If you click on a bomb, the game is over and you lose.

	You can also "flag" tiles that you believe are bombs. This prevents you from clicking on them, and
	helps keep track of how many bombs you have already found.
